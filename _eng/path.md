The [**Pioneer Helmet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Helmet "Pioneer Helmet") is a [boar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boar "Boar")-crested [Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons "Anglo-Saxons") helmet dating from the late seventh century. During a March 1997 excavation, it was found in [Wollaston, Northamptonshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollaston,_Northamptonshire "Wollaston, Northamptonshire"), in a young man's grave, probably the [burial mound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumulus "Tumulus") of a high-status warrior, along with a [hanging bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_bowl "Hanging bowl") and a [pattern welded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_welding "Pattern welding") sword. The sparsely decorated helmet is one of only six Anglo-Saxon helmets yet discovered, joined by finds from [Benty Grange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benty_Grange_helmet "Benty Grange helmet"), [Sutton Hoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Hoo_helmet "Sutton Hoo helmet"), [York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppergate_Helmet "Coppergate Helmet"), [Shorwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorwell_helmet "Shorwell helmet") and [Staffordshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire_helmet "Staffordshire helmet"). Like most of these, it is one of the crested helmets that flourished in England and [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia") from the sixth through the eleventh centuries. Boar-crested helmets are a staple of Anglo-Saxon imagery, evidence of a [Germanic tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_mythology "Germanic mythology") in which the boar invoked the protection of the gods. In the Anglo-Saxon poem [_Beowulf_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf "Beowulf"), such helmets are mentioned five times. Unveiled at the [New Walk Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Walk_Museum "New Walk Museum") in [Leicester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester "Leicester"), the helmet is on display at the [Royal Armouries Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Armouries_Museum "Royal Armouries Museum") in [Leeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds "Leeds").
