# jekyll-i18n
Jekyll Multilanguage StarterKit

This is my simple attempt on creating a full functioning Jekyll based website.

The project is based on Bootstrap 4.1.3 framework and you can find inside several Bootstrap Components adapted for Liquid Theme Language.
Every kind of help is greatly welcomed.
Hope this could be useful for other Frontend Devs

Please feel free to take and reuse the code.
